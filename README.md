# Nightshade Creator
Build web pages with HTML5, CSS, and JS!
 
Under embbedded or nightsahde BETA/embbedded you will find the standalone html required to embed nightshade creator in another site. We do have a folder called blocks, but is is not yet ready. To embed in your site, use our [embbedder JS script](https://github.com/powerbox1000/embedderjs).
